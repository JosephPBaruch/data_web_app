## Docker CLI Cheat Sheet
1. Build an image 
- docker build . -t joseph.baruch/<custom-container_name>
2. Run a container with and publish a containerâ€™s port(s) to the host.
- docker run -it -p <localhost_port>:<expose_port> joseph.baruch/<custom-container_name>
> You wont be able to see it at expose port (only localhost port)

### Coding Log

> Log Started 6/29/2023. Repository initialized 5/2023.

- 6/29/2023: Moved my fetch api calls into a functions so I could callback fetchData();.
- 6/30/2023: Tried to include fetch.js into index.html but there is an issue with the MIME type (?). I need to experiment with this more and figure out how to properly include the file.
- 7/1/2023: Having trouble exporting my fetch.js file in my index.html file. I am not sure what the issue is. Need to continue to research this to figure out the solution.
- 7/2/2023: Reasearched node.js, express.js and javascript to better understand what is going on behind the scenes. Added the path module to my index.js file and this fixed the problem with linking fetch.js file and index.html. Next, I need to figure out how to extract my data value from my .then() promise in fetch.js. 
- 7/3/2023: Was able to successfully display weather data fetched from the Meteomatics API to my localhost server on index.html. I did this through researching more on promises. Result isnt exactly what I want but it will do for now in building my website. Also, updated TODO for each file, updated README, and added styles.css.
- 7/4/2023: Meteomatics allows more parameters withing their URL for fetching data. This will make it very easy to use the same token for multiple data types. It will just take more code withing index.html. I need to see if I can return more than one object in a return statement. 
- 7/5/2023: Now that I can get information to index.html from meteomatics I need to be able to disply it properly. I am going to start to develope my page using html and css. I will explore the idea of learning react but we shall see. Today, all I did was mess around with adding some basic css and html. I added my styles.css file to my index.html file and it worked fine.
- 7/6/2023: Going to start implementing user input for a location that an API (google) then provides the coordinates. Researched a bit about the google geocoding api. Researched how to store html in js. Need to figure out how the order of execution for my api. 
- 7/7/2023: Didnt really have time to code today. Went on a backpacking trip. 
- 7/8/2023: On a backpacking trip. No coding.
- 7/9/2023: Updated coding log and TODO. 
- 7/10/2023: Setup lock that automatically changes time. User imput stored in 'obj'. Need to understand async js to update coordinates in fetch. 
- 7/11/2023: Removed GCP key. Fixed bugs with time in fetch. Researched async javascript. 
- 7/12/2023: Updated coding log, TODO, and worked more in fetch.js. 
- 7/13/2023: Finally fixed the async problem. Was getting a tiny bit of burn out because it was taking so long but I stuck it out. I fixed it by switching fetch.js to a async/await format. Works great! Now need to do this within index.html. 
- 7/14/2023: Tried to implement an async function inside of index.html script tags. This didnt really go anywhere. The main issue that I am having is that I am unable to display information from fetch.js within of index.html. 
- 7/15/2023: Updated coding log. Had a long day so not able to do much. 
- 7/16/2023: Worked on C.
- 7/17/2023: Worked on C.
- 7/18/2023: I was able to display data from the async/await fetch using callbacks. It is now time to start geocoding using the google api. 
- 7/19/2023: Finished my tutoring application for the CSAC. Created multiple fields for user input in index.html. Begain structuring fetch.js for getting a geocoding fetch. 
- 7/20/2023: Updated readme and organized fetch.js. 
- 7/22/2023: Going to get started on environment variables, google geocoding. Hopefully by tomorrow I will be able to send an address and get weather data. 
- 7/23/2023: I was able to make a .gitignore, .env file, and install dotenv. Running into problems getting my environment variables into fetch.js. The issue is require() cannot be used in the browser. Index.js is note used in the browser that is why it can use require. Tried running app with hardcoding credintials and everything works great. Hopefully will figure out how to renew tokens today after two hours. Might ask my advisor about .env values. Was able to get a renewing token using a basic function.
- 7/24/2023: Commented and cleaned up all of my code. I expect to have a meeting with my advisor soon so I want to be prepared. It is good practice too. I need to scrub up on my knowledge of what is going on within index.js. Added more data types and created a function to convert wind direction degrees to a word value. 
- 7/25/2023: Researched how to properly use environmnet variables but didnt get far. 
- 7/26/2023: First tried experimenting with environment variables again but didnt get far either. I have a theory that my issue is not understanding the proper format for fetch() and where to host those calls. My advisor says that fetch shoudl be within index.js but I couldnt include index.js inside of index.html. Postponing that problem I successfully made a docker image and ran a container in localhost . 
- 7/29/2023: Worked on creating an api so that i dont expose my environment variables to the internet.
